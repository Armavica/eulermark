012 - Highly divisible triangular number
----------------------------------------

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So
the 7^th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten
terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

 **1:** 1
 **3:** 1,3
 **6:** 1,2,3,6
**10:** 1,2,5,10
**15:** 1,3,5,15
**21:** 1,3,7,21
**28:** 1,2,4,7,14,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred
divisors?
